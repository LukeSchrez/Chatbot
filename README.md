# Chatbot
Swift Chatbot

# Description
This application is designed to be a simple chatbot developed in the Swift Programming Language.
It will mimic a real life person talking to you, for those that are lonely, bored, or have no friends.
The user is able to ask questions to the bot like "what time is it?" and "what is your name?" for example.
The bot will create responses accordingly with follow up questions. Note that this Chatbot is designed to
follow certain conversation chains. As of this version it is not equipped to handle any and ever type of
question or conversation. We added a help feature to detail what kind of conversations the user can have
with the bot.

# Requirements
The chatbot has the following requirements
* It must be run using Xcode version 14.1
* The current IOS target for this chatbot project is AT LEAST IOS 15.5. Any versions after that should work fine.
* We ran our project using the simulator, running the IOS 16 version on an IPhone 14 Pro.
* Other acceptable models are IPhone X, IPhone 11 Pro, IPhone 12 Pro, and IPhone 13 Pro.
* When choosing a build version for the simulator, make sure your iPhone IOS version is at least IOS 15.5.
